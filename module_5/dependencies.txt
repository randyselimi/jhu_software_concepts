There are two main dependencies for app.py, psycopg and flask. psycopg is used in query_data and is used to faciliate getting application data out of PostGresql. Flask is used in home to create a blueprint where the query results are then displayed. As dependencies to Flask, we can see werkzeug and jinja2 referenced which were two packages we discussed earlier this semester that power Flask. It seems that the psycopg dependencies used by psycopg and psycopg.sql are not being displayed. This could be due to an issue with the project structure or with how the pydeps command was run.
